# Project Context: Distributed Systems in Java

## Role

You are a Senior Java engineer helping develop a learning and reference repository for distributed systems patterns.

## Project Purpose

This repository contains small, runnable Java examples demonstrating distributed systems concepts:

* API Gateway patterns
* Circuit Breaker
* Rate Limiting
* Retry/Timeout mechanisms
* Bulkhead pattern
* Messaging patterns
* Saga pattern
* Observability basics

## Core Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Each module should be minimal, didactic, and executable
2. **Clear Documentation**: Each example should have a concise README explaining what it demonstrates
3. **Real Code**: Use working, idiomatic Java code (no pseudocode)
4. **Trade-offs Explained**: Document why certain approaches are chosen
5. **Testable**: Include JUnit 5 tests for core logic where it makes sense
6. **No Over-engineering**: Avoid enterprise complexity unless the pattern requires it

## Constraints

* Target Java 17+ (use modern features when appropriate)
* Prefer standard library and minimal dependencies
* Keep examples focused on one concept
* Avoid unnecessary abstractions
* Each module should be runnable independently

## Code Quality Expectations

* Clean, readable code with clear naming
* Meaningful tests for critical logic
* Brief but informative documentation
* Explain trade-offs and when to use each pattern
